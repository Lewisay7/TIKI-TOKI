# Optimize Advertisement Moderation
# TIKI-TOKI #

## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of digital advertising, staying competitive means constantly innovating and optimizing ad placement strategies. The TIKI-TOKI Ad Ranking Optimization project emerged as a response to this need, with the goal of enhancing our ad placement algorithms to improve user engagement and revenue generation.

As a cross-functional team, we embarked on this project with a clear mission: to learn, adapt, and overcome challenges in the dynamic landscape of digital advertising. Along the way, we not only honed our technical skills but also gained valuable insights into the intricacies of the advertising industry. This project story captures our journey, highlighting what we learned, the hurdles we faced, and how we meticulously built and deployed our solution.

Join us as we delve into the world of ad ranking optimization, sharing the knowledge we acquired, the challenges we conquered, and the strategies we employed to create a more efficient and effective ad placement system.

## What We Learned

### Technical Skills
- Data Analysis and Manipulation:
Learning and applying data analysis libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to preprocess and manipulate advertising data efficiently.We used it for cleaning, transforming, and exploring the raw ad data.

- Machine Learning and Modelling : 
We took the time to understand numerous machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees,clustering to see what's best fit for the data that we have for ad ranking prediction. Then, we used the best concluded model to run do prediction and optimize ranking strategies

- Version Control Using Git:
We got familiar to using Git both in the terminal and in our respective prefered IDEs so that we can track and manage code changes in our code. This was able to encourage collaborative development and track the changes in our repository. 

### Domain Knowledge
- Ad Review Performance and Moderator Metrics:
We delve into the knowledge of key performance metrics in advertising, such as punish number , task complexity , and review accuracy. In terms of moderators, we understood the criterias for categorising moderators, such as productivity, handling time and accuracy. Using these knowledge, we evaluated and built the ranking models to ensure high-quality content moderation and compliance.

## Challenges Faced

- **Challenge 1: Time Constraints**
We had a limited timeframe to both self learn all of the required knowledge and building the actual model.We had to make rapid decisions, prioritize tasks effectively, and streamline our development process to meet project milestones within the allotted timeframe. This challenge pushed us to be resourceful, adapt quickly, and optimize our workflow to deliver a high-quality solution that met our project objectives.


### Libraries used
